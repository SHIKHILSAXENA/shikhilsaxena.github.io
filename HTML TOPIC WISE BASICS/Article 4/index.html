        Martin Luther King Jr. led many demonstrations against racism. 
        He delivered his message in a non-violent manner. Some members of his 
        movement later engaged in less peaceful protests. Luther King was detained 
        several times. The longest jail sentence he received was four months. 
        Martin Luther King’s famous 1963 speech, “I Have a Dream”, inspired many 
        African-Americans to envisage a better future. Luther King was an American 
        citizen. Nelson Mandela is a native South African. Their dreams were the same.
        Their battles were tumultuous. Nelson Mandela was arrested in 1962 for treason. 
        He was incarcerated for twenty-seven years. Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr.
        both fought for racial equality. The intolerance of white people towards black co-inhabitants 
        was the catalyst for years of activism. In 1994, Nelson Mandela became the 
        first black president of South Africa. He was the first president elected by 
        the people. Mandela and Luther King have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize 
        for their dedication to improving civil rights for black people. During Nelson 
        Mandela’s best known speech in 1994, he recited “Our Deepest Fear”, an 
        inspirational poem by Marianne Williamson. Mandela initially avoided violence 
        but ended up resorting to it following the massacre of unarmed black Africans 
        by the government. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968.
